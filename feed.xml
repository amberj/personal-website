                <p>Every year I have to renew car insurance, I quickly scan this checklist to make sure that I have got maximum coverage for my car, without overpaying for useless addons.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1jc3msljlas">Buying or renewing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Choose your IDV
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Maximize always?</span></li>
<li>Higher IDVs only serve to raise the premium. Payout in case of total loss will be as per depreciated value of the vehicle. It is best not to inflate IDV unnecessarily. Use the <a rel="ugc noopener" href="https://idv.gicouncil.in/" target="_blank">IDV calculator</a> from the General Insurance Council to get an idea of the ideal IDV for your vehicle. (Source: <a href="https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-loans-insurance/238024-car-insurance-return-invoice-vs-idv.html#post5082378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">team-bhp comment</a>) Is this true?</li>
<li>See also content at bottom of this page: <a href="https://idv.gicouncil.in/">https://idv.gicouncil.in/</a></li>
<li>If am getting RTI, I keep the IDV low. If no RTI, the highest IDV possible. (Source: <a href="https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-loans-insurance/238024-car-insurance-return-invoice-vs-idv.html#post5082454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">team-bhp comment</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are renewing and you haven't registered a claim in previous year, make sure that you are getting a no claims bonus (discount) on your premium.

</table>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buy both Own Damage (OD) and Third party (TP)
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is this comprehensive cover?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buy Zero depreciation (also known as "Zero dep")
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is this same as bumper to bumper?</span></li>
<li>Usually offered only for first 5 years.
<ul>
<li>So when you are renewing at the end of 4th year, if you have an option to buy for "3 years" (with zero depreciation included for 5th, 6th and 7th year), opt for it. I forgot to do this.</li>
<li>So when HDFC refused to offer this in 6th year, I checked other insurers and ICICI was offering this. So I switched my insurer, and bought a 3 year policy with zero depreciation included from ICICI (now my car has zero dep for 6th, 7th and 8th year).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buy NCB (no claims bonus) protection addon
<ul>
<li>This add-on cover lets you keep your NCB discount intact even if you raise any claim request up to a certain pre-decided limit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PA (Personal Accident) Cover for driver:
<ul>
<li>15L is mandatory by law in India for every <span style="text-decoration: underline;">driver</span>. But don't buy this for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">passengers</span>.</li>
<li>Don't buy more than 15L, as this cover is rejected for stupidiest of reasons (unlike a Term Insurance policy). I have seen Acko offering a higher cover, but I don't recommend it.</li>
<li>If you already have this cover on any vehicle, you don't need to buy it again (e.g. I have this on my Activa bike insurance, so I haven't bought this for my car).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return to Invoice (RTI) addon:
<ul>
<li>Applies in case of theft as well as total loss (accident or natural calamity)</li>
<li>Usually available for the first 3 to 5 years of buying the car (This is because paying the ‘On Road’ price for an aged vehicle will convert into a financial loss for the insurance provider.)</li>
<li>Take it, if available for as many years as you can.</li>
<li>By bridging the gap between the vehicle and its Insured Declared Value and the actual invoice value, you are liable to be reimbursed for the total ‘On-road’ price of the vehicle you paid when you purchased it.</li>
<li><strong>Full Reimbursement of Invoice Value</strong>: Ensures you get back the complete amount spent on purchasing the car, including taxes and registration fees.</li>
<li><strong>Protection Against Depreciation</strong>: Shields policyholders from the impact of depreciation, which reduces the car's market value over time.</li>
<li>Keeping the car’s purchase invoice is crucial for claims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compulsary/mandatory deductible: The premium amount of the car insurance is not affected by the amount of compulsory deductible.
<ul>
<li>The mandatory deductible sum for private automobiles of 1500 cc engine capacity and above is currently 2,000 INR, whereas for private cars with 1499 cc or lower engine capacity is 1,000 INR. There is, however, a condition. If your automobile is old, your insurance provider may raise your compulsory deductible amount. This is owing to the notion that the amount of risk and likelihood of claims are raised according to the vehicle's age. As a result, when purchasing car insurance coverage, make sure you understand your compulsory deductible value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Voluntary Deductibles: Not mandatory, but try if a Rs. 1000-2000 extra voluntary deductible is significantly reducing your premium. Take a call accordingly.
<ul>
<li>Think like this: Would you rather pay more upfront (and possibly make no claim), or incur some amount only when a claim is registered?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1jc3msljlat">During a claim</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compulsary/mandatory deductible: The mandatory deductible sum for private automobiles of 1500 cc engine capacity and above is currently 2,000 INR, whereas for private cars with 1499 cc or lower engine capacity is 1,000 INR. There is, however, a condition. If your automobile is old, your insurance provider may raise your compulsory deductible amount. This is owing to the notion that the amount of risk and likelihood of claims are raised according to the vehicle's age. As a result, when purchasing car insurance coverage, make sure you understand your compulsory deductible value.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1jc3msljlau">After a claim</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you have NCB protect/protection addon, make sure that the next renewal premium is calculated using this, after a claim.</li>
<li>Verify policy, IDV, addons very carefully after a claim. Compare it with previous year's policy to make sure that coverage and premium is same-ish.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1jc3msljlar">Extended warranty</h2>
<ul>
<li>I bought it for my car from Renault.</li>
<li>For electric cars? must buy?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1jc3msljlav">Other addons/covers that I have NOT tried myself but might be useful</h2>
<ul>
<li>Roadside assistance
<ul>
<li>esp for electric cars?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1">Non-Electrical Accessories/Electrical Accessories (IMT-24)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="p1">IMT (Internal Motor Tariff) 24 in commercial vehicle insurance is offered by insurers to provide coverage<br>for damages caused to electrical and electronic fittings that are not a part of the manufacturer's initial<br>selling price. Some insurers may offer the electrical accessories add-on cover under the IMT 24. The</p>

                <p>After managing multiple static websites across different platforms - from WordPress to my current favorite, Publii - I've learned that certain fundamental elements are non-negotiable regardless of which content management system (CMS) you choose. This checklist ensures your website is discoverable, measurable, and user-friendly from day one.</p>

<p>Whether you're launching your first blog or your tenth business site, skipping these basics means missing opportunities for organic search visibility, tracking traffic growth and engagement, and professional credibility. I've made the mistake of launching sites without proper analytics or search console setup, only to realize months later that I had no data on how visitors were finding (or not finding) my content.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1jb7bubmc2c">The Checklist</h2>
<p>Once you have covered the basic (bought a domain, deploy first page on the domain), you can follow this checklist. This is my <em>website setup ritual</em> for every new website that I deploy:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1jb7bto7p1v" class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Connect to Google Search Console</h3>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Google Search Console is your direct line of communication with Google about how your site appears in search results.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ul class="[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-2.5 pl-7">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Visit <a class="underline" href="https://search.google.com/search-console">Google Search Console</a></li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Click "Add Property" and enter your website URL</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Verify ownership using one of the available methods (HTML file upload, DNS record, or meta tag)</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Once verified, you'll start receiving data about search impressions, clicks, and indexing issues</li>
</ul>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without Search Console, you're flying blind. You won't know which keywords drive traffic, which pages have indexing problems, or when Google encounters errors crawling your site.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1jb7bto7p20" class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Submit Your Sitemap on Google Search Console</h3>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Your sitemap tells search engines which pages exist on your site and how they're organized.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ul class="[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-2.5 pl-7">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Locate your sitemap URL (typically <code class="bg-text-200/5 border border-0.5 border-border-300 text-danger-000 whitespace-pre-wrap rounded-[0.4rem] px-1 py-px text-[0.9rem]">yoursite.com/sitemap.xml</code>)</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">In Google Search Console, navigate to "Sitemaps" in the left sidebar</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Enter your sitemap URL and click "Submit"</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Monitor the status to ensure Google successfully processes it</li>
</ul>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Most platforms including Publii generate sitemaps automatically. Verify yours exists before submitting.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1jb7bto7p21" class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Set Up Google Analytics</h3>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Understanding your audience's behavior is essential for making informed content and design decisions.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ul class="[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-2.5 pl-7">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Create a Google Analytics account at <a class="underline" href="https://analytics.google.com">analytics.google.com</a></li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Set up a new account (and a property under this account) for your website</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Copy the tracking code and add it to your site's header. Test connection.</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Open your website in a tab. Now verify that data is being collected by checking real-time reports.</li>
</ul>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>What to track if you are new to Google Analytics:</strong> Pay attention to traffic sources, popular pages, bounce rates, and user demographics.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1jb7bto7p22" class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Add WhatsApp Chat Button (When Appropriate)</h3>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">For businesses, service providers, or anyone wanting direct customer communication, a WhatsApp button can dramatically improve conversion rates.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>When to include it:</strong></p>
<ul class="[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-2.5 pl-7">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">E-commerce or service-based websites</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Consulting or coaching sites</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Local businesses</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Any site where immediate customer support adds value</li>
</ul>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Implementation:</strong> Use a simple HTML link like <code class="bg-text-200/5 border border-0.5 border-border-300 text-danger-000 whitespace-pre-wrap rounded-[0.4rem] px-1 py-px text-[0.9rem]">https://wa.me/yourphonenumber</code> or integrate a floating button widget for better visibility.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1jb7bto7p23" class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Protected Contact Email</h3>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Spam bots harvest email addresses from websites constantly. Protect your inbox while remaining accessible.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ul class="[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-2.5 pl-7">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Visit <a class="underline" href="https://mailhide.io/">mailhide.io</a></li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Enter your email address</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Generate a protected link that requires CAPTCHA verification</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Add this link to your contact page</li>
</ul>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Alternative approach:</strong> A contact form.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1jb7bto7p24" class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Copyright Notice</h3>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">A simple copyright statement establishes ownership and looks professional.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Template:</strong> <code class="bg-text-200/5 border border-0.5 border-border-300 text-danger-000 whitespace-pre-wrap rounded-[0.4rem] px-1 py-px text-[0.9rem]">Copyright © 2025-26 Amber Jain</code></p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Where to place it:</strong> Typically in the footer of every page, automatically applied through your theme or template.</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Note:</strong> Update the year annually, or use dynamic code to display the current year automatically.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1jb7bto7p25" class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">Social Follow Buttons</h3>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Make it easy for visitors to connect with you on the platforms where you're most active.</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1jb7bto7p27" class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5">RSS or JSON Feed Link</h3>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words">Despite social media dominance, RSS feeds remain valuable for dedicated readers and content aggregators, especially if you have a comprehensive content strategy (or you publish blogposts regularly).</p>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ul class="[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-disc space-y-2.5 pl-7">
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Confirm your feed exists (usually something like <code>https://amberja.in/feed.json</code> or <code>https://amberja.in/feed.xml</code> or <code class="bg-text-200/5 border border-0.5 border-border-300 text-danger-000 whitespace-pre-wrap rounded-[0.4rem] px-1 py-px text-[0.9rem]">yoursite.com/rss</code>)</li>
<li class="whitespace-normal break-words">Add a visible RSS icon linking to your header, sidebar or footer (so that it is visible on all pages of your website).</li>
</ul>
<p class="font-claude-response-body whitespace-normal break-words"><strong>Why it still matters:</strong> RSS gives readers an option to be automatically notified whenever you publish new content, builds a loyal audience independent of algorithm changes, and enables content syndication.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To enter virtual env made by pipenv, use: <code>pipenv shell</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>To exit virtual env, use <code>exit</code> command. Don’t use <code>deactivate</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>pipenv</code> instead of <code>pip</code> to install/uninstall packages:</p><ul>
<li>You can install a package as project dependency for deployment/execution (under packages section of Pipfile using): <code>pipenv install flask</code></li>
<li>You can install a package as project dependency for development (under dev-packages section of Pipfile using): <code>pipenv install --dev pytest</code></li>
<li>To uninstall run this command (which also removes references to python package both from Pipfile and Pipfile.lock): <code>pipenv uninstall django</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The Pipfile.lock is intended to specify, based on the packages present in Pipfile, which specific version of those should be used, avoiding the risks of automatically upgrading packages that depend upon each other and breaking your project dependency tree. This command will lookup your virtual environment folder to generate the Pipfile.lock file for you automatically, based on the currently installed versions: <code>pipenv lock</code> </p></li>
<li><p>Delete a virtual env created by pipenv: <code>pipenv --rm</code></p></li>
<li><p>To see location of virtual env added by pipenv: <code>pipenv --venv</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p><code>brew install pipenv</code></p><h2 id="migrate-requirementstxt-to-pipenv">Migrate requirements.txt to Pipenv</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to your project directory and initialize a Pipfile: <code>pipenv install</code></p><ul>
<li>This should automatically find requirements.txt file in pwd and convert it into Pipfile. In case it doesn’t, you can run: <code>pipenv install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If certain dependencies are only required during development (e.g., pytest or black), you can reinstall them under dev-packages section of Pipenv using: <code>pipenv install &lt;package_name&gt; --dev</code></p></li>
<li><p>Once everything is working fine, you can safely move the old requirements.txt file outside the folder, but still keep it as a backup somewhere.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setup-existing-project-with-existing-pipenv-on-new-laptop-with-fresh-virtualenv">Setup existing project with existing Pipenv on new laptop with fresh virtualenv</h2>
<ul>
<li>Install pipenv, then <code>cd</code> to the project directory which contains Pipenv file.</li>
<li>This command will create a new virtual environment as well as install dependencies listed in Pipfile.lock: <code>pipenv install</code></li>

<li>Download and install Espanso: <a href="https://espanso.org/install/">https://espanso.org/install/</a></li>
<li>Type <code>:espanso</code> in a text field of any app to make sure that espanso is running.</li>
<li>Sync your espanso folder from cloud storage to locally on your Mac.

<ul>
<li>If command printed <code>/Users/nancy/Library/Application Support/espanso</code>, then just remember <code>/Users/nancy/Library/Application Support/</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stop espanso running in background: <code>espanso stop</code></li>
<li>Delete default <code>espanso/</code> folder created during installation (which is located at <code>/Users/nancy/Library/Application Support/</code> as printed in Step-4).</li>
<li>Now create a symbolic link at Espanso's default location pointing to folder kept in Cloud Storage.
<ul>
<li>In my case the command looks like this: <code>ln -s "/Users/nancy/Insync/me.jain1989@gmail.com/Dropbox/espanso/" "/Users/nancy/Library/Application Support</code><br><code>/"</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now restart espanso and try a shortcut stored in your espanso on Dropbox.

<h2 id="mcetoc_1j9p91js92e">TOON format for less token usage</h2>
<p>My colleagues <span class="" role="presentation">Ajay Joshi</span> &amp; <span class="" role="presentation">Deepak Shah</span> were discussing <a target="_blank" class="c-link" data-stringify-link="https://jsontoon.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" href="https://jsontoon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://jsontoon.com/</a> which converts JSON to TOON format which is supposedly a more compact format with less token usage on LLMs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TOON: Token-Oriented Object Notation is a compact, human-readable serialization format designed for passing structured data to Large Language Models with significantly reduced token usage. It's intended for <i data-stringify-type="italic">LLM input</i> as a lossless, drop-in representation of JSON data. Website: <a target="_blank" class="c-link" data-stringify-link="https://github.com/toon-format/toon" data-sk="tooltip_parent" href="https://github.com/toon-format/toon" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/toon-format/toon</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div> </div>
<div class="p-rich_text_section">The example on <a target="_blank" class="c-link" data-stringify-link="https://jsontoon.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" href="https://jsontoon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://jsontoon.com/</a> website compares TOON to "pretty json" (but not to minified json):</div>
<div> </div>
<div><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://amberja.in/media/posts/46/SCR-20251111-mgrr-2.png" alt="JSON to TOON" width="1020" height="956" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://amberja.in/media/posts/46/responsive/SCR-20251111-mgrr-2-xs.png 320w ,https://amberja.in/media/posts/46/responsive/SCR-20251111-mgrr-2-sm.png 480w ,https://amberja.in/media/posts/46/responsive/SCR-20251111-mgrr-2-md.png 768w ,https://amberja.in/media/posts/46/responsive/SCR-20251111-mgrr-2-xl.png 1024w"></figure></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But I was curious to compare: if toon format is consistently using lesser tokens than "minified json". So I searched reddit:</div>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1j9p91js92f">Alternative approach #1</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>First I found another idea that <a target="_blank" class="c-link" data-stringify-link="https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m7bs7y/been_using_this_trick_to_compress_jsons_and_save/" data-sk="tooltip_parent" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1m7bs7y/been_using_this_trick_to_compress_jsons_and_save/" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone has shared</a>:</div>
<div>Here the OP is compressing json</div>
<blockquote>
<div><code class="c-mrkdwn__code" data-stringify-type="code">{ "main_character": { "name": "Miles Piper", "traits": "middle-aged, wiry, musician" }, "setting": { "city": "Nooga", "season": "Spring" } }</code></div>
</blockquote>
<div> </div>
<div>to</div>
<blockquote>
<div><code class="c-mrkdwn__code" data-stringify-type="code">{"mc":{"n":"MilesPiper","t":"mid-aged,wiry,musician"},"set":{"c":"Nooga","s":"Spring"}}</code></div>
</blockquote>
<div> </div>
<div>Disclaimer for this approach: Make sure your original JSONs have enough self‑contained context. When you shorten keys, like if main_character = mc, you’re removing semantic hints [for LLM model]. To keep things clear for the LLM, your original JSON should include enough surrounding info or a parent scope so it’s obvious what domain you’re in.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think that we can solve this with a <code>Taxanomy.md</code> added in system prompt which simply has key value pairs e.g. <code class="c-mrkdwn__code" data-stringify-type="code">mc:main_character;n=name;t=traits....</code><br>

<div class="p-rich_text_section">This post is my own summary of <a target="_blank" class="c-link" data-stringify-link="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp" data-sk="tooltip_parent" href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp</a>, published on Nov 4, 2025.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cloudflare wrote a similar post on 26 Sept 2025: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/</a>. What Anthropic calls as "<em>Code Execution with MC</em>P", Cloudflare calls it as "<em>Code Mode</em>". For the sake of succintness, let's refer to it as "<em>Code Mode</em>" in this blogpost.</div>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1j9enusddm1">Problems with direct MCP usage</h2>
<div class="p-rich_text_section">Problems with direct MCP usage, extra tokens consumed due to:</div>
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet p-rich_text_list--nested" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-list-tree="true" data-indent="0" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Many MCP servers are connected
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet p-rich_text_list--nested" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-list-tree="true" data-indent="1" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="1" data-stringify-border="0">All tool definitions (from each MCP server) are added in context</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Intermediate output from mcp</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1j9eochcjqj">Alternative approach</h2>
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet p-rich_text_list--nested" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-list-tree="true" data-indent="0" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Quoting the blogpost: <code class="c-mrkdwn__code" data-stringify-type="code">LLMs are adept at writing code and developers should take advantage of this..</code>
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet p-rich_text_list--nested" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-list-tree="true" data-indent="1" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="1" data-stringify-border="0">So instead of calling mcp, tell agents to write code for an api wrapper around mcp tools (aka <em>Code Execution with MCP</em>, or <em>Code Mode</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1j9eochcjqk">What makes the Alternative approach better? </h2>
<p>These benefits are especially useful for devs to remember so that you can tell LLM to write code that can handle such things in real world use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read tool definitions on demand (by either letting model navigate filesystem or using some tool like<code class="c-mrkdwn__code" data-stringify-type="code">search_tools</code>)</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="1" data-stringify-border="0">"<em>Code Mode</em>" can filter/transform/aggregate/join/extractColumns on "intermediate output" before giving it to LLM model</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="1" data-stringify-border="0">Instead of chaining mcp tool calls via prompt engineering (which can be unreliable), "<em>Code Mode</em>" can do loops, sleeps, conditionals, and error handling
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet p-rich_text_list--nested" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-list-tree="true" data-indent="1" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="2" data-stringify-border="0">Reduced "Time to first token" latency using conditional tree (if-elif-else), as code can execute it in microseconds (v/s seconds via LLM)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intermediate output stays in execution environments (which are essentially 'temporary' sandboxes). (e.g. fetch+count users via code execution with MCP, without exposing email addresses to model)<br>
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet p-rich_text_list--nested" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-list-tree="true" data-indent="1" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="2" data-stringify-border="0">You can also tokenize more sensitive data (e.g. tokenize when fetching from a CRM, untokenize before logging it into a spreadsheet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give filesystem access, let agent write intermediate results to files: for logging (i.e. track progress) and state persistence (i.e. resuming work)<br>
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet p-rich_text_list--nested" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-list-tree="true" data-indent="2" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="2" data-stringify-border="0">Save "working code with MCP" as reusable functions for future use (in their example in the blogpost, Anthropic team is putting it in <code class="c-mrkdwn__code" data-stringify-type="code">.skills</code> folder)
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet p-rich_text_list--nested" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-list-tree="true" data-indent="3" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="3" data-stringify-border="0">Further quoting blogpost:<code class="c-mrkdwn__code" data-stringify-type="code">Adding a SKILL.md file to these saved functions creates a structured skill that models can reference and use... build a toolbox of higher-level capabilities</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1j9eochcjql">Overhead in "Code Execution via MCP" approach</h2>
<p>Quoting this section of the blogpost, because it's well written and quite concise already:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that code execution introduces its own complexity. Running agent-generated code requires a secure execution environment with appropriate <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-sandboxing">sandboxing</a>, resource limits, and monitoring. These infrastructure requirements add operational overhead and security considerations that direct tool calls avoid. The benefits of code execution—reduced token costs, lower latency, and improved tool composition—should be weighed against these implementation costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1j9eochcjqm">Levaraging familiarity with Software Engineering for your own benefit</h2>
<p>Again, quoting another section of the blogpost, because it's well written and quite concise already:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although many of the problems here feel novel—context management, tool composition, state persistence—they have known solutions from software engineering. Code execution applies these established patterns to agents, letting them use familiar programming constructs to interact with MCP servers more efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until next time...</p>

<ol>
<li>Add to Claude Desktop using: Claude Desktop &gt; Settings &gt; Developer &gt; Edit Config</li>
<li>Open claude_desktop_config.json in your IDE.</li>
<li>Add this JSON code by modifying &lt;INSERT_OPENROUTER_KEY_HERE&gt; (modify the json if there are already MCP servers added):
<pre class="language-json"><code>{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zen": {
      "command": "sh",
      "args": [

      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Restart Claude Desktop. It should now detect ZenMCP server.</li>
<li>From Terminal, run this command and follow the steps:<br>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop</code></pre>
</li>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1j9373o3k13">Run prompt to verify</h2>
<p>Here is a sample prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Plan our microservices migration, get consensus from pro and sonnet4.5 on the approach"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As of Nov 2025:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"pro" refers to "google/gemini-2.5-pro"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>"sonnet4.5" refers to "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5". </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the prompt finishes running, check <a href="https://openrouter.ai/activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Openrouter Activity</a> screen, which should show API calls to "pro" and "sonnet4.5" models being charged to your account balance.</p>
