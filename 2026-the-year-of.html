Something flipped in last few weeks. Hackernews/reddit are filled with links to posts from purist, respected programmers (that I have personally looked up to since 2007 when I started studying programming) suddenly singing praises of LLM coding. Some of these had previously written off "(Vibe/Agentic) Coding with AI" as something that was good for hobby/mini projects, code reviews or first draft.</p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1jfdj1e131d">David Heinemeier Hansson (aka DHH) - Creator of Ruby on Rails</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1jfdjb07g2k">Salvatore Sanfilippo (aka antirez) - Creator of Redis.</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1jfdjb07g2l">Jordan Hubbard  - Co-creator of FreeBSD OS</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1jfdjq8eh8k">Linus Torvalds - Creator of Linux</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1jfdjq8eh8l">Simon Willison - Co-creator of Django</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1jfdjq8eh8m">Terence Tao - Renowned mathematician who won Fields Medal </a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1jfdkcehfas">Ryan Dahl - Creator of Node.js</a></li></ul></div><p>What caused this? I was thinking that it was due to Opus 4.5, and Simon Willison (co-creators of Django web framework) confirmed my suspicion in his post titled "<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/4/inflection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The November 2025 inflection point</a>":</p><blockquote><div class="note"><p>It genuinely feels to me like GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5 in November represent an inflection point - one of those moments where the models get incrementally better in a way that tips across an invisible capability line where suddenly a whole bunch of much harder coding problems open up.</p></div></blockquote><p>Thought AI coding was overhyped? You might want to reconsider and try out either Opus 4.5 or GPT5.2.</p><p>Don't just take my word for it. I present Exhibit A: what renowned programmers (that have inspired me in my career) are actually saying about this:</p><hr><h2 id="mcetoc_1jfdj1e131d">David Heinemeier Hansson (aka DHH) - Creator of Ruby on Rails</h2><p>...CTO at 37signals/Basecamp &amp; author of Rework book.</p><p>On January 7, 2026, he wrote in <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/promoting-ai-agents-3ee04945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Promoting AI agents</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Yes, I'm ready to give the current crop of AI agents a promotion. They're no longer just here to help me learn, answer my questions, or check my work. They're fully capable of producing production-grade contributions to real-life code bases.<br>Supervised collaboration, though, is here today. I've worked alongside agents to fix small bugs, finish substantial features, and get several drafts on major new initiatives.

It could be said that my career was a continuous effort to create software well written, minimal, where the human touch was the fundamental feature. I also hope for a society where the last are not forgotten... But, I would not respect myself and my intelligence if my idea of software and society would impair my vision: facts are facts, and AI is going to change programming forever.</p><p>I thought that we had more time before programming would be completely reshaped, at least a few years. I no longer believe this is the case. Recently, state of the art LLMs are able to complete large subtasks or medium size projects alone, almost unassisted, given a good set of hints about what the end result should be.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id="mcetoc_1jfdjb07g2l">Jordan Hubbard  - Co-creator of FreeBSD OS</h2><p>...along with serious stints at Apple, NVIDIA &amp; Uber)</p><p>On January 19, 2026, he wrote in his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7418827289100070912/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkedin post</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I'm NOT going to call this activity vibe-coding anymore. I refuse. I won'd judge others for using that term, but I will henceforth refer to it as agentic coding "AC" (shorter than "agent assisted coding") because there are no longer any "vibes" about this process for me. I think that Agentic Coding is, in fact, an intensely disciplined activity if one wishes to get the best results so I think it deserves a better categorization!</p><p><br>This is what we used to call "code leverage" and it's accelerating INSANELY for me now.

Those people are in for a very nasty shock in 2026.

For most of 2024 that stayed true. In 2025 that changed, but you could be forgiven for continuing to hold out. In 2026 the quality of LLM-generated code will become impossible to deny.</p><p>Since Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 came out in November and December respectively the amount of code I’ve written by hand has dropped to a single digit percentage of my overall output. The same is true for many other expert programmers I know.</p><p>At this point if you continue to argue that LLMs write useless code you’re damaging your own credibility.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id="mcetoc_1jfdjq8eh8m">Terence Tao - Renowned mathematician who won Fields Medal </h2><p>... <em>Royal Medal</em>, <em>Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics</em> in 2014, and is a 2006 <em>MacArthur Fellow</em>.</p><p>On January 8. 2026, he posted <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a> that GPT-5.2 solved an Erdos problem "<em>more or less autonomously... after some feedback from an initial attempt".</em></p><p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conjectures_by_Paul_Erd%C5%91s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erdos Problems</a> are <em><strong>unsolved</strong></em> mathematical conjectures/problems by prolific mathematician Paul Erdős and his collaborators.

[…]</p><p>In this note I would like to describe a variety of my problems which I would classify as my favorites. Of course, I can't guarantee that they are all 'acorns', but because many have thwarted the efforts of the best mathematicians for many decades (and have often acquired a cash reward for their solutions), it may indicate that new ideas will be needed, which can, in turn, lead to more general results, and naturally, to further new problems.</p><p>In this way, the cycle of life in mathematics continues forever.</p><p> </p><div id="tags" class="align-right"><strong><em>-- Paul Erdős, Some of my favorite problems and results, 1997</em></strong></div></blockquote><hr><p>Edit: added on 20 Jan 2026, when my friend Deepak Shah shared this with me:</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1jfdkcehfas">Ryan Dahl - Creator of Node.js</h2><p>On January 19, 2026, he posted on <a href="https://x.com/rough__sea/status/2013280952370573666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X.com</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This has been said a thousand times before, but allow me to add my own voice: the era of humans writing code is over.
